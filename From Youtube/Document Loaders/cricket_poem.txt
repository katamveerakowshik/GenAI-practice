On a square of dust and emerald green,
Where willow meets a leathered dream,
The pitch lies patient, scored and worn,
Awaiting duels each gentle morn.

The bowler runs with thundered breath,
A measured dance with speed and death,
The ball swings late, a whispered plea,
To bend the laws of gravity.

The batter stands, a quiet flame,
Eyes alight with timing’s game,
One perfect stroke, a crack, a sigh—
The ball writes arcs across the sky.

Applause rolls like summer rain,
For loss and glory share the same plane,
A nick, a catch, a shattered stump,
Hearts rise, then fall, then wildly jump.

From gully’s crouch to boundary’s chase,
Eleven souls, one shared embrace,
In whites or colors, day or night,
Cricket stitches time to light.

For more than runs or numbers told,
It’s patience learned and courage bold,
A game where silence speaks the most—
And every match becomes a ghost.
