      "That’s a year-over-year growth rate of 42% (Q3 2016 versus Q3 2017). We expect AWS\n",
      "to expand the size and extend of its platfo rm in the upcoming years, for example, by\n",
      "adding additional services and data centers.4\n",
      "1.3.2 Services solve common problems\n",
      "As you’ve learned, AWS is a platform of services. Common problems such as load bal-\n",

      "Flexible capacity frees you from planning . You can scale from one virtual machine to\n",

      "no longer need to predict your future capacity needs for the coming months and\n",

      "The cloud has almost no capacity constraints. You no longer need to think about rack\n",
      "space, switches, and power supplies—you can add as many virtual machines as you\n",
      "like. If your data volume grows, you can always add new storage capacity.\n",
      " Flexible capacity also means you can shut down unused systems. In one of our last\n",

      " AWS reduces prices for their cloud services every now and then. A few examples:\n",

      "The idea behind the Free Tier is to enable you to experiment with AWS and get some\n",

      " 750 hours (roughly a month) of a small virtual machine running Linux or Win-\n",

      " Object store with 5 GB of storage.\n",
      " Small database with 20 GB of storage, including backup.\n",
      "If you exceed the limits of the Free Tier, you start paying for the resources you con-\n",
      "sume without further notice. You’ll receive a bill at the end of the month. We’ll show\n",
      "you how to monitor your costs before you begin using AWS.\n",
      " After your one-year trial period ends, you pay for all resources you use. But some\n",
      "resources are free forever. For example, th e first 25 GB of the NoSQL database are\n",
      "free forever.\n",
      " You get additional benefits, as detailed at http://aws.amazon.com/free. This book\n",
      "will use the Free Tier as much as possible and will clearly state when additional\n",
      "resources are required that aren’t covered by the Free Tier. \n",
      "1.4.2 Billing example\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, you can be billed in several ways:\n",
      " Based on minutes or hours of usage—A virtual machine is billed per minute. A load\n",
      "balancer is billed per hour.\n",
      " Based on traffic —Traffic is measured in gigabytes or in number of requests, for\n",
      "example.\n",
      " Based on storage usage —Usage can be measured by capacity (for example, 50 GB\n",

      " Another example: a big server costs exac tly as much as two smaller ones with the\n",

      "use a Linux machine with an optimized distribution called Amazon Linux to\n",
      "install Apache, PHP, and WordPress. You aren’t limited to Amazon Linux; you\n",

      "sending traffic to the failed VM, and th e remaining VM will need to handle all\n",
      "requests until the failed VM is replaced.\n",
      " Relational Database Service (RDS) for MySQL —WordPress relies on the popular\n",

      " Injecting Bash or PowerShell scripts into a virtual machine during startup\n",
      "allows you to initialize virtual machines individually—for example for installing\n",
      "software or configuring services.\n",
      " AWS OpsWorks is good for deploying mult ilayer applications with the help of\n",

      "6.1 Who’s responsible for security?\n",
      "The cloud is a shared-responsibility enviro nment, meaning respon sibility is shared\n",

      " New security updates are released when  your virtual machine is running, and\n",

      "The first two options can be easily included in the user data of your EC2 instance. You\n",
      "can find the code in /chapter06/ec2-yum-update.yaml in the book’s code folder.\n",
      "You install all updates as follows:\n",
      "Instance:\n",
      "  Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'\n",
      "  Properties:\n",
      "  # [...]\n",
      "  UserData:\n",

      "The problem with installing all updates is th at your system becomes unpredictable. If\n",
      "your virtual machine was started last week, all updates that were available last week\n",
      "have been applied. But in the meantime, new updates have likely been released. If you\n",

      "instead of the latest:\n",
      "yum update-to bash-4.2.46-28.37.amzn1\n",
      "Using a CloudFormation template to describe an EC2 instance with explicitly defined\n",

      "only if you and AWS work together. You’re responsible for securely configuring\n",
      "your AWS resources and your software running on EC2 instances, while AWS\n",
      "protects buildings and host systems.\n",
      " Keeping your software up-to-date is key, and can be automated.\n",
      " The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service provides everything\n",
      "needed for authentication and authorization with the AWS API. Every request\n",
      "you make to the AWS API goes through IAM to check whether the request is\n",
      "allowed. IAM controls who can do what in your AWS account. To protect your\n",
      "AWS account, grant only those permissions that your users and roles need.\n",
      " Traffic to or from AWS resources like EC2 instances can be filtered based on\n",
      "protocol, port, and source or destination.\n",
      " A bastion host is a well-defined single point of access to your system. It can be\n",
      "used to secure SSH access to your virtual machines. Implementation can be\n",
      "done with security groups or ACLs.\n",
